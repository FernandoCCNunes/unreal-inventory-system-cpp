# Inventory System
This inventory system was designed with the intention to create simple and complex inventories without having to go through all the complex functionality that it takes to make it work, it's items are UObject based which provides a very easy way to create your custom items with information unique to your game
Also, while designing this system, I wanted to make it as easy as possible and at the same time allow for full customizability, this system while in its development face was tested by building the inventory systems of the following games.

- 4Story/World of Warcraft
- Rust
- Minecraft

To read more about what the functionality is doing, go to the **[Documentation](https://github.com/FernandoCCNunes/unreal-inventory-system-cpp/edit/main/Documentation.md)**.
You also have a basic example **[here](https://github.com/FernandoCCNunes/unreal-inventory-system-cpp/edit/main/Example.md)**.

More examples will come with videos on how to setup different types of inventories.

If you encounter bugs or errors, please point them out **[here](https://github.com/FernandoCCNunes/unreal-inventory-system-cpp/issues)**.
